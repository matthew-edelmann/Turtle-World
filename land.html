                        There are 4 different species of box turtles.
                        The common box turtle, the coahuilan box turtle
                        the spotted box turtle, and the ornate box turtle.
                        Among these there are several subspecies.
                        They have a dommed shell that makes them look box like.
                        This is where it gets its name.
                        Box turtles can swim, but they are not very good at it.
                        They are omnivoric and eat a mix of plants, bugs and eggs.

                        There are 49 different species of tortoises.
                        The Galapagos tortoise is the largest tortoise
                        and also the longest living, reaching over 150 years old!
                        All tortoises are primarily land dwelling although some
                        are partly aquatic.
                        Most species of tortoises don't lay more than 20 eggs.
                        Most species of tortoises are herbavoric. They eat
                        grass, flowers, fruit and various other plants.

                        their eggs. They have an omnivoric diet.

                        There are several species of snaked necked turtles.
                        They are called this because of there long necks.
                        They are native to Australia and its surrounding islands.
                        Unlike other species of turtles, the snake neck turtles
                        don't pull their necks into their shells. Rather they
                        tuck their heads around the side on their bodies.
                        They mostly eat fish and are great swimmers.
                        They are semi-aquatic and spend their time on land and in water.
