                        This species of turtles live in all tropical and
                        subtropical waters. It is found in the Indian Ocean,
                        the Atlantic Ocean and the Pacific Ocean. They spend
                        most of their time in shallow water, eating sea grass.
                        They are a herbivoric species of turtles as adults.
                        However, young turtles are carnivoric; eating worms,
                        sponges, jellyfish, eggs and other animals. 
                        They are currently endagered (oh no!).

                        This species of sea turtle gets its name from 
                        its appearance. Its mouth looks like the beak of 
                        a halk. It is critically endagered. 
                        They are heavily hunted by humans. Many
                        conservation groups work on protecting this species.
                        They are generally 3 feet long at full length.
                        The weigh around 280 pounds. They live between 30 to 50 years.
                        This type of turtle is the only one known to eat sea sponges in Hawaii.

                        The leatherback sea turtle is the largest turtle in the world!
                        They can get over 7 feet long. 
                        They swim in all the oceans except the arctic ocean.
                        They get their name by having a softer more leather like back
                        (compared to most other turtles).
                        Their diet consists almost entirely on jellyfish.
                        They sometimes mistake pastic bags for jellyfish which has lead
                        to a decline in the population.

                        This is a relativly small species of sea turtle.
                        They are about 2 feet long weigh around 110 pounds.
                        They live in tropical warm waters.
                        They have a carnivorous diet, eating only meat.
                        Their eggs are often eaten by pigs and dogs.
                        This turtle gets its name from its olive color.
                        They live for about 50 to 60 years
                        and can swim into depths of around 500 feet.
